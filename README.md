- **Description:** Product (item) name. Nominal.
- **Quantity:** The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. Numeric.
- **InvoiceDate:** Invoice Date and time. Numeric, the day and time when each transaction was generated.
- **UnitPrice:** Unit price. Numeric, Product price per unit in sterling.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
The top 10 most popular items are sold in/to the UK. Apparently paper craft little birdie is very popular, along with medium ceramic top storage jar. I will remove the items with 'NaN' descriptor. These entries associated with nan CustomerID entries and 131 lower case descriptions which describe problems with the orders and no details of the item ordered. In addition, the data for United Kingdom contains negative values associated with negative UnitPrice values. Removing the rows containing NaN values therefore cleans several issues that complicate this analysis in the absence of the data owner.

## Feature Engineering:
- Moving on from exploratory data analysis, are there any features that can be created in order to categorize/cluster aspects of the data and aid machine learning?
